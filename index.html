    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Elijah Goossen 
      and I am studying Electrical Engineering 
      at Dordt College, soon to be Dordt University.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, as a missionary kid.
      When I was nine years old,
      we moved back to the states
      and I started attending Omaha Christian Academy in Omaha, NE.
      I love to read science fiction and fantasy
      and enjoy watching sports with my friends.

      I found out about Dordt through some families at school
      who had children that attended Dordt.
      When I visited, I really liked the feel of the campus community
      and the high priority that the faculty and staff put on their faith.
      I have been challenged in my faith while attending Dordt,
      especially in reconciling different perspectives
      about various theological topics,
      but I think that God will use this challenge to strengthen my faith
      and help me trust in Him.
