    <h2>Why KSP?</h2>
    <p>
      The Kuyper Scholars Program (KSP) is a program
      that allows deeper study in to subjects of interest.
      I have always liked learning and researching my interests.
      I would read extra chapters in my textbooks in high school
      to learn about the subjects that we would not cover in normal class.
      When I was researching colleges,
      I was interested in their honors programs
      because they would challenge me to learn more
      and go deeper into the subject material.
      During the application process,
      I was worried that I might not have the time
      to focus on an honors program,
      and I thought that maybe I should not apply for KSP.
      Under the urging of my admissions counselor and my parents,
      I decided to apply for KSP.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first semester of KSP was composed of a class
      introducing us to Christian Scholarship.
      This class consisted of a lot of discussion which helped me realize
      that more than one viewpoint exist on many issues,
      even within Christian doctrine.
      This class encouraged me to think critically about what I believe
      and think about what people say instead of just accepting or rejecting it.
      I also participated in several Scholars Seminars
      which introduced me to many ideas that I had not considered before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am looking forward to participating more in KSP
      as an opportunity to learn more about things that I am interested in.
      Although I will be learning a lot in my classes,
      KSP will give me an incentive to research outside of my major
      or research deeper within my major.
      KSP is an opportunity for me earn credit
      learning about something that I enjoy,
      and it is also a source of motivation
      to keep pursuing my interest in learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another aspect of KSP that I am excited for is the opportunity
      to get to know my professors more.
      Building relationships with professors is sometimes hard
      because of the number of students in the class
      and the conflicts in scheduling.
      KSP, however, encourages one-on-one work with professors
      in and out of my major and has a structured guiding approach.
      I am looking forward to being able to learn about something
      that I am interested in from someone who specializes in that topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another benefit of KSP is the opportunity to participate in seminars
      and interact with other scholars.
      Presenting research is an important skill to have in any field of work.
      Presenting work at seminars will help me develop the skills necessary
      to condense and present in depth research to people
      who may not be familiar with the topic I researched.
      The seminars will also help me to get used to talking in front of people.
      The seminars provide an opportunity for people to share their research
      and talk with one another about different ideas.
      Attending seminars is a way to expand my perceptions
      on various aspects of the world I live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am excited to begin work on my KSP research.
      I think that KSP will help me manage my time better
      and start producing productive habits
      that encourage learning and interacting with others.
      I want to glorify God by using the mind
      that He gave to its full potential.
