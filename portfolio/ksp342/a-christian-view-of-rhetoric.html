    <h2>A Christian View of Rhetoric</h2>
    <p>
      This essay was my first introduction to the history of rhetoric.
      Even though rhetoric is not one of my favorite subjects,
      I learned that it has a varied and interesting history
      and development into what it is today.
      I think one of the major obstacles I faced
      while writing this essay was distilling the vast amount
      of information into a shorter readable essay.
      Usually I have to research more information
      in order to reach a certain length,
      but this essay required me to decide
      what information to include and what to leave out.
      This was a new and interesting challenge
      that presented itself again while preparing
      to give a speech based on this paper.
      I needed to find a balance between keeping the speech short
      and still presenting some depth of information.
