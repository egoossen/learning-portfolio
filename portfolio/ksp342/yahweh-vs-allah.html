      This essay was fun to write because I enjoy learning
      about different religions and how they compare to each other.
      The essay was harder to write then some of my previous papers
      because the topic was not covered in class
      and therefore I did not have the resources easily available.
      Information on Islam's beliefs is sometimes hard to find
      on reputable websites,
      and like many religions,
      opinions vary on what the beliefs actually mean.
      From the process of writing this essay,
      I learned that I need to be intentional
      about setting a time to do homework.
      Without the structure of a specific time to write the paper,
      I easily procrastinated and got distracted.
      A set time and location for effective studying
      will help me focus and get my work done.
