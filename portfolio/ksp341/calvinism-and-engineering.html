    <h2>Calvinism and Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Writing this essay helped me reinforce
      what I was learning during my introduction to engineering classes.
      I learned more about what a Christian worldview says
      about a “secular” field like engineering.
      During the process of writing,
      I also learned that sometimes I need to take a break
      from my work to let my mind think about it subconsciously.
      This break helps me reduce stress during a mental block
      and helps me focus later.
